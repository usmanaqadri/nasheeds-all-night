Leader of the riders, whenever you reach al-Baan (the name of some tree),
relax there your cattle, and proclaim your love (of the Prophet)
We came with great speed, longing to feel your life
We are mad in love, and stunned by this intensity of love
Leader of the riders, whenever you reach al-Baan (the name of some tree),
relax there your cattle, and proclaim your love (of the Prophet)
Oh beloved of many lovers—those in chains and free alike—
Our souls just long for your alluring love
Leader of the riders, whenever you reach al-Baan (the name of some tree),
relax there your cattle, and proclaim your love (of the Prophet)
Oh my dear resident of Rama (Mecca), my passions are ablaze.
My soul is abstaining from all other things.
Leader of the riders, whenever you reach al-Baan (the name of some tree),
relax there your cattle, and proclaim your love (of the Prophet)
