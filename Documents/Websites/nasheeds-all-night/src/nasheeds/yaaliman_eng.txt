Oh He who knows of what is hidden, You are my closest, intimate friend.
Oh He who is present in remembrance, You are my eternal companion.
Oh Creator of all realms, Lord of existence,
Oh He who sustains mankind from a well of generosity,
Through (our love of) the chosen one, our legendary forefather,
with Your Forgiveness, grant us the eternal abode the highest garden in Paradise
Oh He who knows of what is hidden, You are my closest, intimate friend.
Oh He who is present in remembrance, You are my eternal companion.
How magnificent is the one favored above all servants.
By the revered chosen one, our towering support,
we beseech You Allah to vanquish all our enemies and demons,
and that we be allowed to drink and imbibe the pure goblet in Paradise
Oh He who knows of what is hidden, You are my closest, intimate friend.
Oh He who is present in remembrance, You are my eternal companion.
