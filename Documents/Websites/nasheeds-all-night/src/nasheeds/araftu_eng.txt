I only knew love when I knew love of Thee,
I sealed up my heart against Thine enemy.
My love is twin loves, yet the twain are for Thee,
The first’s for Thy love, and the other’s for Thee.
I only knew love when I knew love of Thee,
I sealed up my heart against Thine enemy.
And as for the first, which is love of Thy love:
Remembrance complete, not distracted from Thee.
I only knew love when I knew love of Thee,
I sealed up my heart against Thine enemy.
And as for the second: my true love of Thee,
I see Thou as present in all that I see.
I only knew love when I knew love of Thee,
I sealed up my heart against Thine enemy.
All praise to Thy name, and no praises for me,
For Thine is the glory in all unity.
I only knew love when I knew love of Thee,
I sealed up my heart against Thine enemy.
