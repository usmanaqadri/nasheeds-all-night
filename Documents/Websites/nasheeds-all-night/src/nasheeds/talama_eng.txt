I'm calling out for you oh Tihāmī (the Prophet), treasure of generosity
My only wish and dearest desire is seeing you,
and seeing your Gate of Peace, oh perfect in fortune
How often I complain about my love for you, light of existence
I'm calling out for you oh Tihāmī (the Prophet), treasure of generosity

My specialty is to praise you, oh complete moon
How often I complain about my love for you, light of existence
I'm calling out for you oh Tihāmī (the Prophet), treasure of generosity
Don’t turn away from me. My love has consumed me.
My master, my time is running out; please be generous in meeting me
How often I complain about my love for you, light of existence
I'm calling out for you oh Tihāmī (the Prophet), treasure of generosity
Enter Madinah and send prayers upon him
Say: "Oh our prophet, oh Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon you"
How often I complain about my love for you, light of existence
I'm calling out for you oh Tihāmī (the Prophet), treasure of generosity
