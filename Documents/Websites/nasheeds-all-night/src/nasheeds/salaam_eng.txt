The appointed time has come; tyranny has come to an end.
The darkness has lifted—its ominous cloud has dissipated.
Finally! A blessed age of peace and relief is nigh!
Eternal salvation has now come in the form of Islam
At last! The blessed seal of the prophets has graced us with his presence.
The honorable mercy to all worlds has graced us with his presence.
An army of angels has sounded a salute to him.
This sound, Lady Aaminah could hear it coming from somewhere.
Peace, oh Aaminah's son, beloved of the Glorified.
Peace, oh pride of all existence, pride of all humankind.
Peace, oh shade of the Merciful, light from the Divine.
Your footprint marks the heading of life's new chapter.
Your arrival brings merriment into the garden of life.
A partner destined to share in worldly matters—a divine bounty.
How bountiful are your face, life, image, light,
smile, conversation, cherishing of slaves, and cheerful demeanor.
The world is longing for a new binding of life's book.
A lot has come from the chapters dispersed throughout the world
The corners of the earth, may they always shine forth light
From your visage, may each atom acquire its brightness
Hafeez is a nobody—just a beggar in an alley of love
His apparent faith merely reflects the light from your benevolence, Prophet
