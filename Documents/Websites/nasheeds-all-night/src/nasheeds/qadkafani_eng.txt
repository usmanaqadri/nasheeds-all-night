Knowing my Lord has in itself sufficed me from needing to ask.
For my supplication and prayer are proofs of my poverty.
Because of this secret, I supplicate in times of ease and in times of difficulty
I am a slave whose pride is in my own poverty and servitude.
Knowing my Lord has in itself sufficed me from needing to ask.
For my supplication and prayer are proofs of my poverty.
O my Lord, my King, You know of my state
and what distresses and anxieties have overwhelmed my heart.
Acknowledge me through some small kindness from You, O Lord of Lords!
Oh Most Honorable in appearance, grace me before my patience runs dry!
Knowing my Lord has in itself sufficed me from needing to ask.
For my supplication and prayer are proofs of my poverty.
Oh Most Swift in mercy! Send forth mercy from You that will reach us quickly,
overcome all tribulations, and bring us all that we could hope for.
Oh He who is near! Oh He who always responds! Oh All­-Knowing and All­-Hearing!
I acknowledge my incapacity, my lack of power, and my brokenness.
Knowing my Lord has in itself sufficed me from needing to ask.
For my supplication and prayer are proofs of my poverty.
