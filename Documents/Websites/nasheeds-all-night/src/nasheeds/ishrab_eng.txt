Drink the beverage of the people of purity *** You’ll see wonders.
With the people of true knowledge *** your time with them is good.
"Oh seeker of the fountain of knowledge *** Your own cloud has hidden it from you.
Look deep into yourself and reflect *** there is nothing but yourself!
Experience and knowledge are wholly from you *** The secret is before you.
You are the mirror of insight *** the eye that observes.
Drink the beverage of the people of purity *** You’ll see wonders.
With the people of true knowledge *** your time with them is good.
Look and witness my beauty *** in every person.
Like running water, passing through *** the root of each branch
Nourished by a singular water *** flowers of all colors
Prostrate to the glory of the Majestic *** when you come near
Drink the beverage of the people of purity *** You’ll see wonders.
With the people of true knowledge *** your time with them is good.
You happened upon us one day *** 'Oh People of immense depth'
I found them as people with true love *** they’re always in a spiritual presence.
Eyes that are wilted [from avoiding sleep] *** faces that are pale [from fasting]
I begged: Can you take me under your wing? *** oh you righteous leaders!
They replied: You must accept our condition *** It is a heavy condition!
You must endure our abandonment *** throughout the nights.
You will return shining as gold *** lo–we shall know ye.
You will drink bitter drinks *** but the bitter will become sweet.
Drink the beverage of the people of purity *** You’ll see wonders.
With the people of true knowledge *** your time with them is good.
Oh Allah send blessings upon the chosen one,
our beloved Muhammad. Upon him may there be peace.
I haven’t got the force. No strength between my sides.
Why feel such remorse when the Maker provides?
I’m but a humble slave, what should I worry about?
All affairs are ordained, of this there is no doubt!
Oh Allah send blessings upon the chosen one,
our beloved Muhammad. Upon him may there be peace.
