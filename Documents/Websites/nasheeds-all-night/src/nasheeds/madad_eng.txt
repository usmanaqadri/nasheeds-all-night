Every heart turns to the beloved.
For this I have a witness and a proof.
The proof is that whenever I mention the name “Muḥammad,”
I witness the eyes of lovers flood with tears.
This is the messenger of Allah. 
This is the chosen one. This is, to the Lord of the worlds, a dear friend. 
The support, assistance, and aid—oh messenger of God.
The support, assistance, and aid—oh beloved of God.

Honor these souls of ours with a chance to meet with the best of creation.
The support, assistance, and aid—oh messenger of God.
The support, assistance, and aid—oh beloved of God.

Give us help in our religion through these prayers upon Muḥammad
The support, assistance, and aid—oh messenger of God.

Oh Lord, we ask you by the prophet and his family
to hasten our victory and reach a spiritual opening.
Oh Most Generous of those who forgive, have mercy on this slave at Your Door undeterred. 
And complete my actions in their fullness so that I am saved in the gathering on That Day.
Oh Lord, we ask you by the prophet and his family
to hasten our victory and reach a spiritual opening.
