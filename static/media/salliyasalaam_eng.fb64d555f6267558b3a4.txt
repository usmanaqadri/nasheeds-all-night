Source of Peace, send blessings upon our great intermediary,
the sun of creation and the face of all worldly beauty.
Oh server of true lovers, fill up these vessels
with the ultimate wine that'll revive our souls.
Other suns have risen from the Infinite Presence
piercing the veil of Layla's countenance.
Source of Peace, send blessings upon our great intermediary,
the sun of creation and the face of all worldly beauty.
The desire of these lovers at the time of manifestation,
is the exalted master alongside the Essence of the Creator.
At the time of manifestation, from the Boundary of Infinity,
there is Layla's beauty, in all splendid things.
Source of Peace, send blessings upon our great intermediary,
the sun of creation and the face of all worldly beauty.
Birds sing out songs above pulpits,
Flowers and gardens breathe out pure scents,
Strings trill notes as the beloved one is present.
Dear wine keeper, sing more of Layla’s charm!
Source of Peace, send blessings upon our great intermediary,
the sun of creation and the face of all worldly beauty.
Oh fountain of fountains, you appear lucid
In every symbol that is of cup and wine.
Sorrows have disappeared. The Presence has made it sweet,
by the protected secret of Layla’s treasure
Source of Peace, send blessings upon our great intermediary,
the sun of creation and the face of all worldly beauty.
