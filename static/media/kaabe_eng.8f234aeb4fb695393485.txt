When I first laid eyes on the Kaaba—
what a sight! The whole world seemed unmemorable.
In an instant, my sense and understanding were paralyzed,
and my heart forgot its pleasure for frivolity.
Thereafter, my spirit felt behooved to dance,
and my sleeping frenzy soon awoke.
The need to move my feet came back to me,
and my need to see had disappeared.
When I arrived at the entrance of the Kaaba,
a blessed cloud came and enshrouded us.
Nothing from my senses seemed to remain.
What did I even ask for? What did I forget to ask?
When the time came to raise my hands and supplicate,
I could not remember what I thought of beforehand.
In my rhythmic expression of my beliefs,
I forgot to express what things I truly wanted.
When I first laid eyes on the Kaaba—
what a sight! The whole world seemed unmemorable.
