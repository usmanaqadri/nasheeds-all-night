Leader of the riders, when you reach the tree al-Baan,
let's give the cattle a break and proclaim our love (of the Prophet).
We came with great speed, longing to feel your life.
We are mad in love, and stunned by its intensity.
Leader of the riders, when you reach the tree al-Baan,
let's give the cattle a break and proclaim our love (of the Prophet).
Oh beloved of many lovers—those in chains and free alike—
our souls just long for your enchanting love.
Leader of the riders, when you reach the tree al-Baan,
let's give the cattle a break and proclaim our love (of the Prophet).
Oh my dear resident of Rama (Mecca), my passions are ablaze.
My soul just abstains from all other things.
Leader of the riders, when you reach the tree al-Baan,
let's give the cattle a break and proclaim our love (of the Prophet).
