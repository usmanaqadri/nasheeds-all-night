The secret of the self is hidden in "No god but God."
Should the self be a sword, it is made sharp by "No god but God."
The Abraham of this age is being sought out.
The world is a home of idols, cleansed only by "No god but God."
The wealth and riches of the world, the ties of kinship and marriage
all are illusory constructs. The sole truth is "No god but God."
You have struck a bargain for these material, vain goodsâ€”
a real sham of a purchase and a waste next to "No god but God."
Although idols are hidden within the sleeves of the masses,
I still have a duty to raise my hands and proclaim "No god but God."
This verse is not confined to the season of tulips and flowers.
Be it spring or fall, "No god but God" will forever endure.
