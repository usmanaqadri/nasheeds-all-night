The ultimate goal is not far from anyone,
but neither can one say it is close at hand.
Whomever He selects, He will grant it.
This is about the door of the beloved!
Whomever He's chosen is invited to the door.
Whomever He's chosen becomes His guest.
These are very elite decisions that are made.
Only the truly fortunate ones are considered.
He is not God, by God he is not.
But at the same time, he cannot be separated from God.
So what is he then? Well what is he not?
This is a matter reserved for the Lover and His beloved.
That thing obstinately awaited on the path,
whereas this thing clung to the door.
That thing was the frustration of some notable,
but this thing was the speech of a beggar.
Munawwar you poor man, do you
want anything else from the door of our king?
Should one ever get the chance, just keep looking at it.
And understand that even this is something truly fortunate.
The ultimate goal is not far from anyone,
but neither can one say it is close at hand.
Whomever He selects, He will grant it.
This is about the door of the beloved!
