Please come back and be with me. Come back!
Because my reunion with you brings new life.
Bring it closeâ€”this reunion and closeness.
Because closeness for lovers is a celebration.
Please come back and be with me. Come back!
Because my reunion with you brings new life.
Here take my heart and inspect it.
Flip it and turn it as you wish.
If you find anything other than you in it,
then extend at my expense, the distance between us.
Please come back and be with me. Come back!
Because my reunion with you brings new life.
May everyday be a day I see you,
only then will I have truly happy days.
Please come back and be with me. Come back!
Because my reunion with you brings new life.
This love swirls around a light brighter than a multitude of suns,
like how a wine of love makes souls alive and sway.
Oh brother in pain, leave everything else other than it.
And whoever rejects this, leave them to their own ruin.
My dear friend, in its manifestation your grief will cease.
I seek its protection from my shortcomings in order to see my own purity.
This love swirls around a light brighter than a multitude of suns,
like how a wine of love makes souls alive and sway.
