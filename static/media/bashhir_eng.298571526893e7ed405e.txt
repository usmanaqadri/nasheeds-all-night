Give glad tidings to the people of insight: the sun has now shone!
After all that hiding, my crescent has finally appeared.
The mountain of my heart is pulverized now that the beloved lifts the veil.
As he manifests himself, I delight in stripping all shame in the name of love.
I say, "Oh perfect spirit of creation, be intimate with the aches of my heart,"
He responds, "I do not bring near me hearts that make others their beloved‚Äù 
I say, "God is my witness, I am dying for you alone,"
He says, "If you desire this closeness, then get ready for my visit."
Oh my life, leave me. My love is to become life for me.
My mind and religion hasten to comprehend his essence, then his characteristics.
Since this full moon appeared, all of what I've wanted is coming
Say to the people of true vision, "Authenticate what is behind the veil"
Oh my Lord, send prayers upon the one who brightens all existence,
Ahmad, who is truly with those infatuated with him, becoming their master.
And upon his entire family, the lords of true experience of God.
And the same for his companions, all of them, as long as the nightingale sings.
