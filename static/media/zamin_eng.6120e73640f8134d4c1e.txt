All of time and space are for you.
The whole world and its inhabitants are for you.
The "why" and the "how" are for you.
The two worlds were made for you.
The tongue in my mouth is for you.
The soul in my body is for you.
We came here for you,
and we'll rise there for you.
The sun and moon, the night and dawn,
the leaves and the tree, the garden and its fruit,
this sword and shield, this crown and girdle, 
and the standing order are all yours.
Neither the Archangel, the Highest Heaven,
the Book of Records, nor anyone else anywhere
could comprehend your secrets were they unveiled;
they were concealed since Genesis for you.
May the morning breeze flow and pollinate the garden,
and its flowers blossom and make our days pleasant.
Under the banner [of love] and out of praise,
may Raza's mouth open for you.
All of time and space are for you.
The whole world and its inhabitants are for you.
The "why" and the "how" are for you.
The two worlds were made for you.
