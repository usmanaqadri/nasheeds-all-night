Is it from remembering the old neighbors of Dhu Salami
that you have mixed blood with the tears flowing from your eyes?
Praise be to God, the One Who created out of nothingness.
And blessings be upon the one He chose from the beginning of time.
Oh my Lord! Always send salutations and greetings forever
upon Your Beloved, the Best of Creation.
Muhammad is the leader of both worlds, creations,
and groups from the Arab and non-Arab.
That Muhammad is the pride of the world—the king of man and jinn.
He is the leader of both realms, the sultan of Arabs and non-Arabs.
One day, our leader of all nations asked Gabriel,
"You have seen the entire world, tell me how do I compare?"
Gabriel responded, "Oh honorable king of the God's true religion.
By God, there is no one comparable to you!"
Oh my Lord! Always send salutations and greetings forever
upon Your Beloved, the Best of Creation.
He is the beloved—the one whose intercession is desired
for each and every fear and distress that is to come.
Oh my Lord! Always send salutations and greetings forever
upon Your Beloved, the Best of Creation.
He is the beloved—the one whose intercession is desired,
the one who helped people in all of their courage-breaking difficulties.
Oh my Lord! Always send salutations and greetings forever
upon Your Beloved, the Best of Creation.
Oh my Lord, by the chosen one, let us achieve our goals.
Forgive us for what happened in our past, oh Most Generous one!
Oh my Lord! Always send salutations and greetings forever
upon Your Beloved, the Best of Creation.
