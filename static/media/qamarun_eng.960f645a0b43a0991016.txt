A moon—our master is like a moon.
Beautiful—our master is beautiful.
Eyes had never beheld any as beautiful as you.
No woman had ever borne a child as pure as you.
You were created free from all imperfections,
as if you were created however you wished.
A moon—our master is like a moon.
Beautiful—our master is beautiful.
The palm of the chosen one is like a rose petal.
His fragrance remains on the hands that touch it.
His favor encompasses all the servants.
Beloved of God, oh best of creation,
A moon—our master is like a moon.
Beautiful—our master is beautiful.
There's no darkness on you—only light!
A light from which the sun and moon emanate.
Without its presence, there would be no guidance.
All existence bears light from the light of Taha!
A moon—our master is like a moon.
Beautiful—our master is beautiful.
