There is an etiquette in yearning,
for my devotion is not true devotion.
My master, all of this is due to your nobility,
that we continue to find prosperity.
Call him a bearer of glad tidings or a warner.
Call him a light-giving lamp.
From head to toe, he is the exemplar of God's Word.
This is the image of my master's existence.
I have been blessed with this affliction of love.
Where did this sinner's misfortune go?
For this grace, how could I ever be worthy?
As his servant, I have the Prophet's special attention.
What is the basis of my actions?
Nothing besides that which comes with shame.
Let my connection to him remain intact.
This is the only hope I have.
There is an etiquette in yearning,
for my devotion is not true devotion.
