Celebrations Of The Coming Of The Messenger,
The Flower Of Lady Aminah.
When The Master Was About To Come,
The Maidens And Boy Servants Of Paradise Began To Rejoice.
The Light Spread Everywhere,
With The Coming Of The Chosen One Came Life To Us All.
O Halima In Your Lap Has Arrived,
The Messenger Of Both Worlds.
When the face of the Prophet was able to be seen
The stars and the moon themselves would shy away.
Seeing This, Aminah Began Smiling,
Eve And Mary Too Began Rejoicing.
Lady Aminah Began Saying To Everybody,
The Prayer Has Been Accepted.
