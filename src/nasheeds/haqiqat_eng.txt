The reality is that they don't experience life's subtle sweetness—
those people whose hearts find no warmth in remembering the Prophet.
On their tongues comes no complaint of sorrow or pain.
Those who take the Prophet's name remain unfazed when met with grief.
The court of the Prophet is right here. You don't even need to ask for it.
You fool! You don't need to be doing all this begging and pleading.
You senseless fool! Just pledge your life to him when at his grave.
These moments don't come again and again in life.
Each flower in the Prophet's garden is like this:
evergreen but without the need of water, never withering away.
Hamid, whoever is clinging to the bottom of his merciful shirt,
will never need to spread their hands out before any other.
The reality is that they don't experience life's subtle sweetness—
those people whose hearts find no warmth in remembering the Prophet.
