May God's blessings, by all the stars that appear,
be upon Ahmad, the best of those who rode on camels.
The lead rider spurred the camels onwards by singing about the beloved,
and that intoxication swayed all throughout their bodies.
Did you not see how they took longer steps
and how streams gushed out of their eyes.
May God's blessings, by all the stars that appear
be upon Ahmad, the best of those who rode on camels.
They turned to and longed for the sanctuary with such rapture,
yearning for those lands and fields.
So stop pulling the reins and trying to drive the camels.
Their yearning is the driver, pulling them towards the city.
May God's blessings, by all the stars that appear
be upon Ahmad, the best of those who rode on camels.
As ecstatic as they are, you too be ecstatic in rapture.
If you are not, then you are a pretender in the path of love.
There, the valley of Aqiq is coming into view!
The domes in the district and tents can now be seen!
May God's blessings, by all the stars that appear
be upon Ahmad, the best of those who rode on camels.
And there is the green dome!
In it lies a Prophet whose light illuminates all darkness.
Our pleasure has indeed been authentic, and now the meeting draws near,
and true felicity has arrived from every direction.
May God's blessings, by all the stars that appear
be upon Ahmad, the best of those who rode on camels.
Say to the self: "Do not seek any personal enjoyment!
Today, everything other than the beloved is off limits.
Relish with every intention this moment with the beloved,
then indeed happiness will be yours and everything else will vanish.
May God's blessings, by all the stars that appear
be upon Ahmad, the best of those who rode on camels.
