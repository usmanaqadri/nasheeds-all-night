Oh Leader of the messengers, my support,
you are the door to Allah, my reliance!
So in this life and in the hereafter,
messenger of Allah, please hold my hand.
I swear by the stars that descend,
the healthy and the sick are nothing alike.
So renounce both worlds with the exception of
love for the master of both Arabs and non-Arabs.
Oh Leader of the messengers, my support,
you are the door to Allah, my reliance!
So in this life and in the hereafter,
messenger of Allah, please hold my hand.
The master of masters from the lineage of Mudar.
The relief to people of the desert and cities.
The one entrusted with the (Quran's) verses and chapters.
The source of laws and wisdom.
Oh Leader of the messengers, my support,
you are the door to Allah, my reliance!
So in this life and in the hereafter,
messenger of Allah, please hold my hand.
No eye has ever seen nor will ever see
the likes of Taha in all humankind.
He is the best those who've walked the earth.
He is pure in character and disposition
Oh Leader of the messengers, my support,
you are the door to Allah, my reliance!
So in this life and in the hereafter,
messenger of Allah, please hold my hand.
