May God's blessings, by the number of stars in the sky
be upon Ahmad, the best of those who rode on camels.
As they listened to the lead camel rider sing the name of the beloved,
the other camels began to sway, drunk in love.
Did you not see how they took longer steps
and tears of joy poured out of their eyes.
May God's blessings, by the number of stars in the sky
be upon Ahmad, the best of those who rode on camels.
They longed for such places and fields.
They turned towards those areas with such yearning.
So stop pulling the reins and trying to drive the camels.
Their yearning is the driver, pulling them towards life.
May God's blessings, by the number of stars in the sky
be upon Ahmad, the best of those who rode on camels.
You must also be overtaken by the melody like the camels are.
If you are not, then you are a pretender in the path of love.
There, the sight of the village Aqiq can be seen.
It is a sight of housetops and tents.
May God's blessings, by the number of stars in the sky
be upon Ahmad, the best of those who rode on camels.
And there is the green dome!
In it lies a Prophet whose light removes all darkness.
The pleasure is validated as the meeting draws near,
and happiness has arrived from all different sides.
May God's blessings, by the number of stars in the sky
be upon Ahmad, the best of those who rode on camels.
Say to the self: "Don't take your sweet time!
Today, everything other than the beloved is off limits.
Take your time with purpose when you are with the beloved.
Then indeed happiness will be realized and everything else will vanish.
May God's blessings, by the number of stars in the sky
be upon Ahmad, the best of those who rode on camels.
