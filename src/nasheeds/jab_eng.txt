Whenever I find someone traveling to Madina,
I am grieved knowing he is there but I remain here.
I don't even have the strength to move my feet,
but my desire pulls me towards, and lo and beholdâ€“I'm moving!
Those going in caravans are already so much further ahead.
Oh desire of mine, help me, so I can follow behind them.
So that those who'd hinder on the path don't find out,
I cover up my footprints as I tread onwards.
By the grace of my master, I Ameer, now have the strength of patience.
Whatever obstacles come before me, I overcome them and keep on moving.
Whenever I find someone traveling to Madina,
I am grieved knowing he is there but I remain here.
