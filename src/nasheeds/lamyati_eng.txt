No equal to you has ever been sighted, nor has any like you ever been born
The crown of the world's kingdom only suits your head, for you are the king of both worlds.
The sea has risen and the waves are crashing. I am helpless and the storm is overtaking me.
I am in a whirlpool and the winds are raging; take my ship help me ashore.
O Sun! You have seen my night, when you pass by Taybah tell her about my state,
The twinkle of your light has illuminated the world but my night has yet to see day.
You have a full moon in your perfectly handsome face, and your tresses are like a halo around it.
Your radiant face with its halo is a full cloud. Come and shower us with a rain of mercy
I am thirsty and your generosity is filled to the brim, oh pure tresses, oh noble cloud 
Your rain falls little by little. Come and drizzle a couple of drops here too.
O fellow travelers, please lengthen your stay. Show mercy to the thirsty desirous lips.
My heart is beating and palpitating. Don't come and say it's time to leave now!
How wonderful were the moments that have goneâ€”those spent in the eminent court.
When I reminisce, I can't believe how trouble-free the journey to Madinah used to be.
My heart is hurt and my emotions are down. My heart suffers, and my mind and soul are worse.
Your honor, who shall I tell of my pain? Besides you, oh beloved soul, who do I have?
My soul is yours. Stoke the fire, add another spark to my fiery love for you.
My body, mind, and wealth have all burned out. Come and set my soul ablaze now too.
That's enough, weak pen, voice of Raza. This is not my style nor my manner.
It was the request of loved ones that was speaking, and my poor self fell victim to this path.
No equal to you has ever been sighted, nor has any like you ever been born
The crown of the world's kingdom only suits your head, for you are the king of both worlds.
