Why should I not be in love with Madina?
My master's grave lies in Madina.
How could I not be drawn towards Madina?
Both my life and hereafter are in Madina.
From the Celestial Heaven comes its great dignity,
and from the grave of the Prophet is its renown.
There is no region that could ever match it.
Only in Madina could there be such a region.
So therefore I have no fear of dying.
Forget about dying—I don't even care about living much.
All I wish for is the Prophet to say to me:
"Now you can live and die here in Madina."
I have an earnest request for the leader of the two worlds,
in a state of ritual purity and with eyes filled with tears—
that my name be included on his list
of those who can everyday go to and from Madina.
Once my sights were set towards Madina,
my heart and soul soon followed suit.
Muneer, how could I remain here,
when all that I have is in Madina?
Why should I not be in love with Madina?
My master's grave lies in Madina.
The scent that comes from the flowers in garden is nothing
compared to the perfume that comes from the sweat of the Prophet.
