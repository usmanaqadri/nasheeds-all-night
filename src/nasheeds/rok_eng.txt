My connection to you wards off
however many arrows are aimed at me.
The favor from the Prophet is upon us,
and all incoming distress is averted.
Now what? Can anyone really put us down?
We have every support to keep us close.
We put ourselves down over there,
where those who are about to fall recover.
My means are very meager.
I really don't have much.
Yesterday I was fed from his morsels.
And today I am fed from his morsels.
He truly is someone who fills every beggar's bag
He understands everyone's dialect and speech.
Come, let's go to the market of the Prophet.
Even false money is accepted there.
The sheer amount of light from just mentioning the Prophet
reaches unlimited heights, oh Khalid.
This light will never wane.
It is a sun that will never set.
My connection to you wards off
however many arrows are aimed at me.
The favor from the Prophet is upon us,
and all incoming distress is averted.
