The ultimate goal is not far from anyone,
but neither can one say it is close at hand.
Whomever He selects, He will grant it.
This is about the door of the beloved!
Whomever He's chosen is invited to the door.
Whomever He's chosen becomes His guest.
These are very elite decisions that are made.
Only the truly fortunate ones are considered.
He is not God, by God he is not.
But at the same time, he cannot be separated from God.

That thing obstinately remained on the path,
whereas this thing clung to the door.

Munawwar, you poor man. Do you
want anything else from the door of our king?
If you have the chance to look upon it,
then know that this is reserved for the truly fortunate.
The ultimate goal is not far from anyone,
but neither can one say it is close at hand.
Whomever He selects, He will grant it.
This is about the door of the beloved!
