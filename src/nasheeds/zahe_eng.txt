What luck! The Prophet of Truth brings
greetings and a divine message.
Lower your gaze and lay your eyes;
the highest occasion for decorum has come.
Who is this ready to give his life
striving in this path of love?
Out of sheer amazement are the angels' sights fixed.
Who is this man of honor that has come?
In the air are voices saying "I am here"
that echo from earth to heaven.
Everyone is ready to pledge their life,
waiting to see whose name is called.
This is the path of truth: tread carefully.
The destination is here, beneath each step.
When you reach his door, say: "Master,
accept my greetings, your servant is here."
Say: "Oh master, so many adore you,
but I anxiously left and came to you.
They were waiting for an invitation,
but it came neither in the morning nor in the evening."
What luck! The Prophet of Truth brings
greetings and a divine message.
Lower your gaze and lay your eyes;
the highest occasion for decorum has come.
