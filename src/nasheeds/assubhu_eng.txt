The sparkle of night is from the shimmer of his hair.
The light of dawn is from your beautiful face.
The sparkle of night is from the shimmer of your hair.

Trees walked towards him; stones spoke to him.
The moon was split by a wave of his hand.
By a motion of his finger, trees would move.
By a miracle, stones would begin to speak.
The moon itself was split into two pieces,
by a mere motion of his finger.
