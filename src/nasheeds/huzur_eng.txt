Prophet, let there be some sort of arrangement
where this servant can greet you in person.
Just once I want see the sun come up in Madina.
Then what would it matter were my world to then enter its night.
How I wish to fill my dear beggar's cup with his radiance.
If only I could have been raised in his own back street!
Prophet, whatever words you hear, they become decisive speech.
Prophet, whatever words you say, they are carried out.
What enjoyment if the angels come to my grave and say:
Sabih, let your praise of the best of creation endure!
Prophet, let there be some sort of arrangement
where this servant can greet you in person.
