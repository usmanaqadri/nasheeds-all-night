The morning breeze carries a message from the Prophet's garden.
An invitation has come to me from the palace of the Prophet.
Every sigh reaches the heavens: this is the sigh's fate.
For every tear is a paradise: this is the value of a tear.
This present has come to me from the court of the Prophet.
An invitation has come to me from the palace of the Prophet.

An invitation has come to me from the palace of the Prophet.
Knowledge's sweet pastry, refinement's drink, patience's cup.

Come and ask this from any who is lovesick for the prophet.
An invitation has come to me from the palace of the Prophet.
The morning breeze brings a message from the Prophet's garden.
An invitation has come to me from the palace of the Prophet.
