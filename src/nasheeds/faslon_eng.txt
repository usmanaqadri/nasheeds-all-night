If these great distances feel too inconvenienced by us,
know that we are neither helpless nor in need of any support.
All we need to do is call out to God's messenger from far away,
if our feet give out on the way.
We will roam by ourselves in Medina
and will aim to get lost in its many streets.
Once we get there, we won't want to come back.
People will try to find us, but they will get exhausted.
As soon as we see the green dome,
our manner of servitude will change.
Who could even have a chance to bow their heads,
when tears from eyes will have already fallen in prostration?
Wherever there be a mention of our master's name,
wherever there be anyone remembering him,
light, and even more light will fill hearts,
and radiance will reverberate through the entire gathering.
You, who just visited Madina, for God's sake
do not relate to me the story of your trip,
because as the story will progress, my heart will begin to race,
and my welled up tears will gush out.
The Prophet's bounteous gaze is aware of
the extent to which each traveler wants to travel.
Iqbal, once we too have been given permission,
we will journey all the way to our master's house.
If these great distances feel inconvenienced by us,
know we are neither helpless nor in need of any support.
All we need to do is call out to God's messenger from far away,
if our feet give out on the way.
